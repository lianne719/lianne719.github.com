title: About me
---
<p>Currently enjoying summer holidays before commencing my last year of my Bachelor of Software Engineering/Commerce degree from the University of New South Wales, I have been very reluctant to do anything but relax. This site has been empty since I got hold of it a few months ago, but thanks to GNOME's Outreach Program for Women, I have a motivation to start blogging and organizing my work online. As mentioned, I recently got accepted as an intern in Mozilla through OPW, and will be with them from January to April, 2013. As such, most of my blog posts will be related to my experience with FOSS and the internship.</p>

<p>My skills lean towards software application and user interface, while my interests also include those in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer vision, machine learning, and web design. </p>
