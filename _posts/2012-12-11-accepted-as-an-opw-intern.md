Had a sleepless night and got up only to find the real announcement time to be at 6am tomorrow (8pm GMT) ![*T_T*](http://www.pic4ever.com/images/292.gif) Thankfully, [Lukas](https://github.com/lsblakk) sent me an email in the afternoon and I finally knew that I GOT IN! ![*YAY!*](http://www.pic4ever.com/images/47b20s0.gif) Anyway, I'll be jotting down anything related to my internship here. Looking forward to an invaluable experience and a helpful starting contribution towards the FOSS community!

I would like to thank the GNOME OPW coordinators and Mozilla for organizing and sponsoring this wonderful program! And congratulations to the applicants who got in!
